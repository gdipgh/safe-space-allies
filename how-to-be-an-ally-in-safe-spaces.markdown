# How to be an Ally in Safe Spaces

Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that provides affordable programs for adult women interested in learning web and software development in a judgment-free environment.
A large part of our mission is to create these safe spaces. We've created some guidelines to help our allies maintain and contribute to the safety, comfort, and mission of our events.

## Who is the target audience of Girl Develop It?

Anyone who identifies as a woman.

Our vision is to create a network of empowered women who feel confident in their abilities to code and build beautiful web and mobile applications. By teaching women around the world from diverse backgrounds to learn software development, we can help women improve their careers and confidence in their everyday lives.

We are committed to making sure women of all races, education levels, income and upbringing can build confidence in their skill set to develop web and mobile applications. Our goal is to provide powerful hands-on programs to women seeking professional help in software development and create basic to advanced web and mobile applications.

While we welcome everyone to Girl Develop It, we aim to create a safe space for women to learn. If you’re here, and you don’t belong to our target audience, we hope you are here as an ally.

## Here are some tips on how to be a respectful, effective, and helpful ally.

### Listen, listen, listen.

We do really mean listen here. Don’t do the thing where you listen just enough to wait for your turn to talk. Don’t listen just for things to pedantically argue about. Really listen to people.

- Use the labels/pronouns/names/etc. they request you use.
- Avoid using labels/pronouns/names/etc. they request you avoid.
- Avoid topics they say upset them. (e.g. a specific kind of joke may be upsetting because of their history)
- Be thoughtful about their accessibility needs (e.g. facing someone who reads lips when you speak to them)
- Respect boundaries they set.

### Take a back seat.
Remember that these events aren’t for you, but you’re there to help by providing support.  If you’re also there to learn, feel free to ask questions, but make sure that you are not dominating the conversation. There are probably more places where you feel safe to learn than there are for our members.

### Keep a relaxed, respectful tone.
Allow space for, and respect, any emotional energy that may come up in conversations. Occasionally, things may become uncomfortable, and that’s exactly the time to stay calm and listen. When speaking, remember that you don’t need to feel defensive, you’re here to support and learn.

### Don’t be overbearing with advice.
If, without solicitation, you find yourself telling others how to do something, or if you feel upset that the target audience doesn’t seem interested in your expertise, you are not being a good ally.  Remember to take a back seat.

### Learn how to make mistakes.
When criticized or called out, Allies listen, apologize, act with accountability, and act differently going forward.  Sometimes you’ll make mistakes. We all make mistakes. No matter how you come to the realization that you made a mistake, accepting it and apologizing earnestly are both vital steps in moving past it.

### Accept a level of discomfort.
Part of being an ally is being uncomfortable. Learning about your level of privilege, realizing past or present mistakes, all of these things are uncomfortable.

### Know when to step out.
If the space is becoming dominated by others who are not the target audience, consider bowing out and coming back later. In most situations, the target audience should dominate the space in both number and voice.
